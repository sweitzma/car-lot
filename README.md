# Car Lot
Some tools to help me buy a new car off craigslist. This repo contains some
helper modules to scrape craigslist and visualize the cost of the car as well
as show images of the car itself.

The jupyter notebook is the showroom where all my options are shown off.

The salesman module contains all of the helper functions.

You can start Jupyter Lab with all the requirements via
```
make lab
```
