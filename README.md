Some tools to help me buy a new car off craigslist. This repo contains some
helper modules to scrape craigslist and visualize the cost of the car as well
as show images of the car itself.

### Showroom
The jupyter notebook is the showroom. Run the cells to see the cars off craigslist with some automatic price analysis.

### Salesman
The salesman module contains all of the helper functions.

### Running
You can start Jupyter Lab with all the requirements via
```
make lab
```
